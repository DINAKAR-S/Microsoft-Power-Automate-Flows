# Automated Email Attachment Intake & Deal-Based Folder Organization

## Overview
This project demonstrates an automated document intake workflow built using Power Automate.

The flow listens for incoming emails, dynamically creates a deal-specific folder, and stores all email attachments in the correct location. This ensures consistent document organization and eliminates manual filing.

## Business Problem
Teams often receive important documents via email:
- Loan documents
- Client-submitted files
- Deal-related attachments

Manual downloading and organizing:
- Wastes time
- Causes misfiling
- Leads to missing documents

## Solution
This workflow fully automates the process:
1. Detects new incoming emails
2. Extracts deal-related identifiers
3. Creates a dedicated folder per deal
4. Saves all attachments into the correct folder
